For the final project of my Fluid Mechanics class, MAE 3230, my group and I took apart a leafblower to see how it works. Over the span of several lab sessions we unscrewed tons of screws, pried apart plenty of press-fit parts, and used lots of elbow grease. To document our findings, we filmed a video showcasing our dissection sprocess as well as some of the mathematical underpinnings behind the different components that we observed. 

My specific contributions to the video were a good deal of the scripting of the first half, the deep dive into the shape of the volute mathematical sidebar, and the carburetor/venturi analysis mathematical sidebar. Outside of those specific items, I helped with the mathematical reasoning behind the centirfugal pump specific speed and pressure drop relation (i.e. describing why this design works better in a centrifugal vs. axial configuration), and general other nuts and bolts throguhout the video. All 4 of use participated actively in the dissection itself, so there isn't a good way to give credit for the manual efforts required to take the leafblower apart.
