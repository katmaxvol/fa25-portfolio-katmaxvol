As the final groupwork of my System Dynamics class, MAE 3260, my group (consisting of Lea Staller, Nicholas Schneider, and Justice Rose) designed a pitch controller for a Boeing 747-400 plane by:
1. Using publicly-available geometric data to quantify how the forces acting on the plane at level flight at 35000ft above sea level relate to the various notable flight angles.
2. Finding the transfer functions between these relevant angles and pitch and using Laplace transforms to define a state-space model of the system.
3. Creating a MATLAB script to calculate all of our coefficients and more effectively model system behaviors.
4. Use SimuLink to model a PID controller to meet certain decided-upon performance requirements.
