An effective professional engineer is fundamentally a service provider: someone who translates complex technical ideas into decisions that serve stakeholders, clients, their team, and society. While technical competence is essential, and I am building these skills through summer internships and classes, engineering solutions rarely succeed on technical merit alone. As an undergraduate, I aim to intentionally develop non-technical skills that can help make me the best possible professional in my future chosen industry.

Professionalism, to me, centers on knowing one’s audience and how to most effectively communicate both technical and non-technical ideas to them. Explaining a design tradeoff to a colleague requires a different approach than presenting risk to management or constraints to a client, and learning the distinction between these approaches is something that schoolwork alone cannot provide. I can work on this skill as an undergraduate through leadership experiences and work opportunities, both on campus and during the summer through internships. It is through these types of higher-stakes projects and group efforts that these communication skills are tested and refined. I intend to pursue opportunities that place me in collaborative environments where outcomes depend on coordination and shared accountability rather than individual performance alone.

Another goal I have for my undergraduate years is to work on documenting and reflecting on engineering work. Clear documentation of design decisions, assumptions, and failures is critical for effective teamwork and long-term project success: it is much more efficient to learn from past mistakes and successes rather than repeating them over and over again. A wise person once told me that documentation of thought processes and design decisions can be an engineer's most important skill, and I definitely see the value in this advice. Through this portfolio and more consistent personal journaling, I aim to build and reinforce the habit of recording not just what I did, but why decisions were made and how they evolved from point A to point B. This practice encourages self-awareness, improves future decision-making, and supports collaboration with my peers.
