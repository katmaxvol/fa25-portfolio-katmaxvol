My top strengths include my adaptability, positive outlook, and my communication.

I consider my adaptability to be one of my top strengths because of comes into play by consistently balancing multiple activities on campus with lots of academics, being able to succeed in all of them. I love to take on new projects and adapt myself to new situations because I love to learn, and see challenges as a way to grow.

While my positivity comes into play in many areas of my life, I find that this strength mostly manifests in my teamwork and leadership skills. I am  able to come up with solutions to problems because of my future-forward mindset, and am always working optimistically to reach my goals. This makes me a good addition to any team I'm in, and allows me to focus on solutions without getting bogged down by temporary inconvenience.

Communication is essential for teamwork in both school settings and the wider world, and I work hard to be a good communicator that can express my thoughts clearly and efficiently. This strength has helped me in many places, including leadership on my project team, explaining hard engineering concepts to students in the classes that I’m TAing, and presenting my product design to my whole class. I am constantly working on my communication and flexing my presentation muscles through all of the activities, classes, and jobs that I am involved in.
