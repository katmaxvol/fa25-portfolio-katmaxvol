My leadership philosophy is that the best leaders prioritize open communication of expectations, since it allows for the most productive work overall for everyone. The best leaders and mentors in my life are always able to describe the objective of particular tasks or approaches and take feedback from those around them to pursue the optimal path.

In my freshman year of college, I joined a student-led project team called Cornell Concrete Canoe, and I have held various positions within it. I was a regular member of the Mold sub-team during my first year, then a junior lead of my sub-team in my second year, and I now hold a new-member educator/advisor role due to spending my next semester abroad.

I have also been a member of the course staff for several CS classes during the 2024-2025 academic year, where I led laboratory sessions, held office hours, and coordinated with dozens of other course staff on how to best grade the exams and assignments for very large classes. This opportunity allowed me to demonstrate both my leadership and teamwork skills through my interactions with the students of the class and with my colleagues who helped teach them and manage their coursework.

Through this experience, I discovered my passion for teaching, so I have made an effort to involve myself in similar types of on-campus roles. I have since been an engineering Peer Advisor and led weekly seminars introducing engineering freshmen to the resources available to them through Cornell, and an AEW facilitator holding weekly workshops supplementing students’ understanding of several core engineering classes.
