My name is Kat Volkova, and I am a junior studying mechanical engineering at Cornell University. I am also pursuing the Business Minor for Engineers through Cornell’s Dyson School of Business. I am from New York City, having grown up in Lower Manhattan and attended high school in Brooklyn Heights. I am involved with many things on campus, including being a member and junior lead of the Cornell Concrete Canoe Engineering Project Team; a committee member in SWE; holding various course staff positions throughout Cornell Engineering and the Bowers School of Computing and Information Science; and being an AEW facilitator and peer advisor for several semesters now. I love to teach and present course material in my own way, and these experiences have given me a great deal of confidence in my grasp of the engineering fundamentals. My academic interests include mechanical design and project management, but I am also really enjoying my fluid mechanics and materials classes this semester. I am particularly excited about sustainable engineering and will be taking classes on green fuels and resource economics during my next semester abroad in Denmark. This past summer, I had an internship in the general contracting/ construction management industry, and I’m eager to apply everything I learned to my school career and beyond. I specifically worked on coordinating between trade partners and architects, ensuring health & safety on the jobsite, and an independent project in HVAC equipment commissioning. Outside of academics, I’m an avid artist, reader, explorer of Ithaca’s swimming spots, and amateur baker.
