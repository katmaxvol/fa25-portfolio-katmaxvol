In the next three to five years, my primary professional goal is to work as a mechanical engineer in industry after graduation in order to build a strong technical and practical foundation to base the rest of my career upon. Since this would be very early on in my career, I especially value breadth of experiences and would find it exhilarating to be thrown into the deep end of design constraints, multidisciplinary communication, and all-new fields.

While I have not yet committed to a specific industry, I have found that sustainability has been a common thread in my interests, and I see it as something I must focus my engineering work on in the future. I plan to explore more about how this interest applies to engineering during my semester abroad in Denmark, where I will take classes about green fuels and resource economics to supplement my knowledge from a sustainable engineering class that I took in my freshman year.

I am very drawn to fast-paced, future-forward work environments where learning is continuous and expectations are high. I find that I thrive in settings that require adaptability, collaboration, and initiative, and I want to work in a role where engineers are encouraged to take ownership of their designs and approach their work with sustainability in mind. In the longer term, I hope to grow into positions that allow me to influence design direction and decision-making, with my experience in leadership in my undergraduate years translating to a more management-oriented path in the future.
