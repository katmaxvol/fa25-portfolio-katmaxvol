My core values of Achievement, Community, and Curiosity guide how I make decisions, set my goals, and define how I approach challenges in both academic and professional settings.

The value of Achievement motivates me to set ambitious goals and constantly strive to do better than last time. I often feel comfortable in high-achieving, high-expectation environments because they help me grow. My goal is to look back on my undergraduate years as a time marked by meaningful accomplishments in leadership among my peers, on student project teams, and during my internships.

Community, as one of my core values, constantly reminds me that my success is rarely individual. I highly value collaboration, mentorship, and mutual support, and I actively seek environments where people help one another learn and improve. Whether it’s working in a student group or a professional setting, my goal is to contribute positively to a group’s dynamic and to create spaces where others can also thrive.

Curiosity drives my desire to understand how and why things work, and it is what drove me to mechanical engineering in the first place. Because of this value, I am constantly asking questions and approaching education as a lifelong endeavor. Connecting ideas across disciplines allows me to provide different perspectives to any conversation I’m in.

As informed by all of these core values, my ideal career would involve strong relationships with my colleagues and a culture of shared innovation, where I face new and exciting challenges every day.
